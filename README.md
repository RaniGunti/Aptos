Title: Proof of Product: Blockchain Against Counterfeits

Description:Supply chain management suffers from poor transparency, leading to issues such as redundancy, weak coordination, and lack of standardization. Product counterfeiting, increasingly difficult to detect visually, causes major losses for legitimate businesses. Existing solutions like RFID, AI, and QR codes have limitations, including vulnerability to duplication and high computational demands. There is a need for a secure, scalable method to ensure product authenticity and traceability throughout the supply chain.

WorkFlow:
Step 1: Secure Login: Show the manufacturer connecting their Petra wallet.
Step 2: Add Product Details: Display the form where the manufacturer enters the brand, product ID, batch number, etc.
Step 3: Generate QR Code: Show the transaction being approved in the wallet and the unique QR code appearing on the screen. Emphasize: "This QR code is now the product's unforgeable certificate of authenticity."
Slide 7: Live Demo - Part 2: The Buyer's Experience
(Show screenshots or a short video clip)
Step 1: Scan the Product: Show the buyer's view with the camera opening to scan the QR code.
Step 2: Instant Verification (The "Aha!" Moment):
Success Case: Display the "Product is Verified" screen with all the details fetched directly from the blockchain. Point out that this data is trustworthy.
Failure Case: Display the "Product is Fake" screen. Explain that this result appears because the QR data does not match any valid record on the blockchain.
